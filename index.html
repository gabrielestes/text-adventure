  <h1>The Viva Hack</h1>
    <page class="intro">
      <p>
        The year is 2035. The economic crash of 2029 sent large corporations
        into desperate situations, banding with hacker groups from Russia and China.
      </p>
      <p>
        The U.S. government’s DoD is too preoccupied with defending against an
        influx of foreign cyber attacks for them to monitor large corporations.

      <h2 class="part-one">The Crime</h2>
      <p>
        It’s been two years since you were convicted of a cyber attack against Viva Pharmaceuticals.
        Going to prison wasn’t the worst that could come from attempting to expose the corporation's trade deals with black market drug suppliers.
      </p>
      <p>
        People you know have disappeared. Notably, a few from your Iron Fist cohort.
        Your attack on the company would’ve led to intel on the location of your friends.
        The information’s there, you just need to try again...

      <h2 class="part-one">The Cell</h2>
      <p>
        You’re in a cell. The cell bars are controlled by consoles to the right of door hinges.
        You look down at the floor, and notice four wires running up to the console.
        You pull out some nail clippers from your shoe.
      </p>
      <p>
        Will you cut the red, blue, white, or black wire? You know that one of
        these will set off the alarm...

      <h2>Outside the Cell</h2>
      <p>
        Great work.
      </p>
      <p>
        The cell door opens to a hall. There's a door at the end, and a door to the
        side. The door has a wooden tag with the sheriff's name engraved into it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Do you open the sheriff's door or proceed to the end of the hall?

      <h2>Go Home</h2>
        <p>
          You exit through the back door and find yourself in the alley that cuts
          through to the main downtown street. You could get to your apartment faster
          if you take that route...but your chance of detection from cops is higher.
          Two turns.
        </p>
        <p>
          To your left is another end of the alley, but you'd have to trespass gang
          territory. Three turns.

      <h2>Gang Territory</h2>
        <p>
          These alleys are littered with dumpsters, stray animals, rusted pipes, and
          inebriated junkies.

        <h2 class="danger">Gang Fight</h2>
          <p>
            You've encountered a gang member who doesn't like your face. Their left
            shoulder shifts back and a fist raises. You deduce it's aimed at your nose.
            You can either counter-attack or block. A counter-attack can win you the fight
            on a success (75%), but you will lose the fight if you fail. A block will
            has a chance to block the hit (75%), but you have a smaller chance to hit
            on your turn (50%). They'll get another hit if you miss.

        <h2 class="apartment">Safe at Your Apartment</h2>
          <p>
            You reach your aparment safely. You creep up the wooden staircase
            to the fourth floor and enter your code on the touchscreen outside
            your door.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your flat hasn't been cleaned for months. The carpet stains make its
            original color indiscernible. The dishes topple out of the sink
            so you've turned to paper plates. But you don't give five flocks of flying
            rubber duckies because you gotta hack to save your friends.
          </p>
          <p>
            You jump in your office chair and swiftly log in to your laptop.
            You remember the structure of Viva's security framework: nodes, capture
            points, and alarms.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your mission is to get a capture point. To get to a capture point, you
            have to capture two nodes. If you fail to capture a node or capture point,
            the alarm will sound and you'll die from blue light exposure you shoulda
            gotten those gamer glasses.

            You have a 60% chance to secure a node. If you succeed, you continue
            to the next node, then the capture point.
          </p>
          <p>
            The alarm will sound if you fail five times during a hack.
